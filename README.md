**Django Hotel Booking Models (Practice Project)**

This is a practice project I created about 4 years ago while learning Python and Django.
The project focuses on building basic models for a hotel booking system, including:

Hotel model → stores hotel information

Booking model → stores booking/reservation details

Demo model → used for experimenting with Django ORM

The main purpose of this project was self-learning and exploring how Django handles models, relationships, and migrations.

**What I Learned**

Setting up a Django project and apps

Defining models in models.py

Creating relationships between models (ForeignKey, ManyToMany)

Running migrations to apply model changes

Using the Django Admin to view and manage models

Basic use of SQLite as the default database
